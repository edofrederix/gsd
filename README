                               SUMMARY
=====================================================================

TODO is a utility used to
create and manage to-do lists. It provides basic functionality such
as:

1) Adding, deleting, and modifying to-do items

2) Updating an item's status (new, incomplete, complete) as you work on it

3) Flagging items that are most important

4) Viewing items for a given status to see all completed jobs, all new jobs, etc.

Currently only a single to-do list is created. In the future any number
of lists will be able to be created and used so that you can have lists for home,
work, etc.

=====================================================================
                           GETTING STARTED
=====================================================================

To get started place the file "todo" somewhere in your PATH. The
easiest what to see what does what is to run:

todo help

from the command line. To add your first items run:

todo edit -a "Learn how to use todo"
todo edit -a "Wash the dishes"
todo edit -a "Walk the dog"

To show the new entries, run:

todo show

and you should see the items that where entered as:

1:(N): Learn howto use todo

2:(N): Wash the dishes

3:(N): Walk the dog

Each entry is composed of three parts: 

<tag>:<status>: <statement>

The tag is used to reference items when editing or deleting them,
status lets you know the progress, and statement is the text you would
jot down on your to-do list.

Since you are on the way to learning todo, go ahead and change the
status of the first item with:

todo edit -s I 1

Showing the entries again shows that the status was updated to "(I)" for
"in progress/incomplete". To look at only the new items run:

todo show -n

and similarly the incomplete items:

todo show -i

In some instances it is useful to flag some items to be important so
they recieve the immediate attention. An important flag "(*)" may be toggled by using

todo edit -i <tag>

Doing this for item 2 in list we get:

1:(I): Learn howto use todo

2:(N): (*) Wash the dishes

3:(N): Walk the dog

from "todo show". To unmark the item, just toggle it off with the same
command. If you have a lot of items, you can tag the most important
ones then choose to view only these by:

todo show | grep \*

Once you are done with an item either mark it as complete with:

todo edit -s C <tag>

or delete the item using:

todo edit -d <tag>

After you delete items you'll notice that the tag numbers remained the
same and may not be continuous. This was done to ensure that if todo
is ran several times successively the tag number will remain the same
and the wrong tags won't be referenced. To see this, let's delete item
2 from our list with:

todo edit -d 2

to get:

1:(I): Learn howto use todo

3:(N): Walk the dog

from "todo show". Notice the tag numbers are 1 and 3, not 1 and
2. Although not necessary, the tags can be put in successive order
with:

todo edit -r

to get:

1:(I): Learn howto use todo

2:(N): Walk the dog

from "todo show".

Enjoy.

Please note I had already named this program "todo" before I saw the
cutesy smartphone app. So no I did not rip off their name - I just
removed the "-" from "to-do" :-)
